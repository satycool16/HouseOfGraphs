Invariants in Java
===

Example of a Java-program that computes a graph invariant.

Program `org.grinvin.hog.invariants.main.Diameter`
* Input (stdin) a *single* graph as an adjacency matrix (HoG format)
* Output (stdout) diameter of the graph (int), `Infinity` when the graph is
  disconnected, `NaN` when the graph is empty
